Roshfall
========

A Dota 2 mod - Titanfall meets Dota 2. Made using Workshop Tools Alpha.

## What's the game mode like?

 - It's a lot like regular Dota, except after assisting your team enough, you can summon a Rosh Mech to take control of!
 - Rosh Mechs deal a lot of damage and have cool abilities!
 - Be careful of the enemy investing in anti-mech items!
